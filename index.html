          Beginnings
In 1984, El Cuarteto de Nos played their first show, an instrumental set in the "El Tinglado" theater.[1] They also played at the "La Máscara", "El Circular", "Teatro de la Alianza Francesa" theaters while their own musical style was being developed. In 1984, their first album was released, in collaboration with Alberto Wolf, whom had six of the twelve songs; and drummer Álvaro Pintos joined the group.

In 1985, they stepped on a stage, located in a fair from Villa Biarritz, dressed up with aluminum foil on their legs and balloons tied into their heads.[2]

First albums
In 1986, they edited their first LP, Soy una Arveja (I am a Pea), on which they performed some hits,[1] and the following year, at a concert they performed, the members were dressed up as old ladies, promoting the song Soy una Vieja (I am an Old Lady).[2] In the same year, their second album was released, Emilio García (by then, the fictional manager).[2]

In 1990, the album Canciones del Corazón (Songs of the Heart) was released in cassette, it was a commercial success.

Unexpected success
In 1994, after four years of hiatus, they released their album Otra Navidad en las Trincheras (Another Christmas in the Trenches), which achieved quadruple platinum status almost instantly, making them the first Uruguayan band ever to achieve it.[2] This album has a wider musical amplitude, having mixed salsa, music, and electronic music, in the band's usual mocking style, the most successful songs of this album were Sólo un rumor (Just a rumour), El primer oriental desertor (The first Uruguayan deserter), Soy un capón (I'm a eunuch), Bo Cartero (Hey, Mr. Postman; a mocking, Spanish version of Please Mr. Postman), El putón del barrio (The biggest slut in the neighbourhood) and Me agarré el pitito con el cierre (I caught my peepee in the zipper, being said in a childish manner).

Mocking their success, they call their 1995 album Barranca abajo (Downhill), this album is acknowledged as darker than their previous works, and exploiting the success generated by Otra Navidad en las Trincheras, they released in the same year, the album La misma porquería (The same rubbish), a compilation of their first three albums.
